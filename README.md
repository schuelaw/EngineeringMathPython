# EngineeringMathPython
A few scripts I created while teaching engineering math Spring 2015

The scripts that start "Ex-" correspond to exercises from


 Applied Partial Differential Equations with Fourier Series and Boundary
 Value Problems, 5th ed.

 by Richard Haberman, Southern Methodist University

 ISBN-10: 0321797051 â€¢ ISBN-13: 9780321797056 

The rest are just demonstrations and illustrations that I created for
class.  

The scripts were all written in Python 3.  They use matplotlib, numpy,
sympy and scipy modules.  They're the result of me trying to shed my
dependence upon Maple, Matlab, and/or Mathematica for generating in-class
examples.  I'm new to Python, but so far I can do everything that I might
have done in those other commmercial packages.
